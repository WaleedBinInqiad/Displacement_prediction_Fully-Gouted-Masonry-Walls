# Displacement_prediction_Fully-Gouted-Masonry-Walls
This repository features the python code for GUI developed to predict lateral displacement of fully grouted masonry walls under in-plane axial loading.
Here are some tips how we have developed the GUI.
1) Python must be installed.
2) relevant libraries must be installed
3) Run it in IDEs such as VS code, Jupyter notebook, Anaconda, Spyder, etc.
4) Load code*.

* Make sure to change directory 

Tips to run code.
1) Install all libraries
2) Make sure all files uploaded here are contained in relevant folder
3) Just run the code.
4) Using scroll adjust input values
5) Click on predict under model (click on relevant property to be predicted)
6) See output
7) Clear the values using clear button
8) Change values and repeat the process from 2 to 6
